        Name: MalwareInsight Analysis Script
        Author: Daniel Pesavento
        Date: 3/07/2023
        Dependencies:
            - MalwareInsight supplied ProcmonConfiguration.pmc file including tailored filters
            - Folder containing Process Monitor (procmon.exe)
            - Folder containing FakeNet (fakenet.exe)
        
        Description:
        This script is a monitoring tool that captures system and network activities and generates log files for further analysis. 
        It utilizes two external tools, Process Monitor and FakeNet respectively, to gather the necessary data. 
        Here is a breakdown of the script's functionality:

        1. The user is prompted to select the folder where procmon.exe (Process Monitor) is installed.
        2. The user is prompted to select the folder where fakenet.exe (FakeNet) is installed.
        3. The script initializes the monitoring tools by starting Process Monitor and FakeNet.
            - procmon.exe is initialized with a .pmc filter to remove noisy/unimportant idle system events
            - fakenet.exe is initialized in its specified directory, launching with no console ouput, log location and utilizing the default.ini configuration.
        4. The user can press 'Q' to finish the monitoring process.
            - Both processes are terminated.
            - The Process Monitor output.pml is opened, filter applied, and extracted as a .csv.
            - The Fakenet log output is directed toward to current working directory of this script.
        5. The script creates a zip file named reports.zip on the user's desktop.
        6. The monitor_report.csv file and fakenet_logs.txt file are added to the zip file, awaiting retrieval from the MalwareInsight Host Client.
        Overall, this script provides an automated way to monitor system (file events, registry events, DLL Loads) and network activities, generate reports, and package them into a compressed file for easy distribution or analysis.
