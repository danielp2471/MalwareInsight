# MalwareInsight
MalwareInsight is a comprehensive and user-friendly Malware Sandbox that simplifies the process of generating Malware Analysis reports. It offers a step-by-step local solution for setting up a secure VirtualBox-powered Sandbox. Additionally, it utilizes flexible analysis software and common, open-source Malware Sandbox tools that when parsed through MalwareInsight, create a honed set of reports aimed at providing a readable set of significant events caused by a malicious process/file within the sandbox.

MalwareInsight allows the user to view these events in two, dynamic HTML formats. One being for non-technical stakeholders, such as executives and staff, while the other is a purely technical report, compiling important information about the file and its activities.

Recorded activities include:
- Process events (process creation, start)
- File system events (creation, deletion, modification)
- Registry events (key creation, deletion)
- DLL Loading
- Network events (domain requests, tcp/udp connections)
- PCAP records (packet capture)
