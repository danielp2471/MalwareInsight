# MalwareInsight
MalwareInsight is a user-friendly Malware Sandbox that offers a local solution for creating and securing a VirtualBox-powered Sandbox. Additionally, it utilizes flexible analysis software in conjunction with programmatically interacting with standard, open-source Malware Sandbox tools that when parsed through MalwareInsight, create a honed set of reports aimed at providing a readable set of significant events for stakeholders.

MalwareInsight allows the user to view these events in two, dynamic HTML formats. One being for non-technical stakeholders, such as executives and staff, while the other is a purely technical report, compiling important information about the file and its activities.

Recorded activities/information placed into the reports include:
- Process events (process creation, start)
- VirusTotal Anti-Virus ratings based on a submitted sample
- File system events (creation, deletion, modification)
- Registry events (key creation, deletion)
- DLL Loading
- Network events (DNS requests, tcp/udp connections) and unique hosts
- PCAP records (packet capture)


# Compatibility
MalwareInsight's host client and analysis tool is exclusively designed for Windows 10 OS and is compatible with both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.
Recommended virtualbox instances running Windows 10 OS should utilize at least:
- Memory: 4096 MB
- Disk space: 50-80 GB of space
- 2 core processors and or 2 GB of RAM.

Your system will also need to allow Powershell scripts to run on it by default. Can do this by running PowerShell as admin, and run:
- Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
